<h2>Initializing new instances. Constructor</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p><strong>Constructors</strong> are special methods that initialize a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a new object is created through the new keyword, followed by a class constructor. | The object is an instance of the class, and it has its own state, which is stored in fields. The object's behavior is defined by the methods in the class. When a new object is created, memory is allocated for it on the heap, and the object's constructor is called to initialize its state. The object can then be used and manipulated throughout the program.">new object</a> </strong>of the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A class in Java is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. | It defines the properties and behaviors of an object through the use of fields and methods. Fields describe the object's characteristics, while methods describe what the object can do. Classes can be divided into two categories: instance and static. Instance classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name, and can have any name that does not start with a digit.">class</a>. A constructor of a class is invoked when an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, instance refers to an object created from a class. | It is an instance of that class, meaning it has its own unique state and behavior defined by the class.

Keywords are part of the syntax, a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid. For instance, the keyword 'final' is used to declare a constant variable, indicating that its value cannot be changed after being initialized. However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a> <code class="language-java">new</code>.</p>
<p>A constructor is different from other <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A method in Java is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. | It is a fundamental unit of functionality in Java, similar to a function in other programming languages. Methods are used to encapsulate code, making it reusable and modular. They can take inputs in the form of parameters, and return outputs. Methods can also be overloaded, allowing for multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. They are a crucial part of object-oriented programming, as they represent the behavior of objects and classes.">methods</a> in that:</p>

<p>Constructors initialize <strong>instances</strong> (objects) of the class.

A class can have multiple fields, and they are used to store the current state or data of the instance of the class. Fields can be accessed and modified through methods, and they are a crucial part of object-oriented programming in Java.">fields</a> when the object is created. Also, constructors can take parameters for initializing fields by the given values.</p>
<h5 id="using-constructors">Using constructors</h5>
<p>Here is a class named <code class="language-java">Patient</code>. An object of the class has a name, an age, and a height. The class has a constructor with 3 parameters to initialize objects with specific values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {

    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient(String name, int age, float height) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.height = height;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's go further and create some instances of the class using the constructor we've written:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient1 = new Patient("Heinrich", 40, 182.0f);
Patient patient2 = new Patient("Mary", 33, 171.5f);</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two patients, Heinrich and Mary, with the same fields, but the values of those fields are different.</p>
<h5 id="keyword-this">Keyword this</h5>
<p>In the example above, <code class="language-java">Patient</code> constructor takes three parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.height = height;</code></pre>
<p>To initialize the fields, the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> is used, which is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/18747" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A reference in Java is a variable that holds the memory address of an object. | When you create an object, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) assigns a unique memory address to it. The reference variable then stores this memory address, allowing you to access and manipulate the object. References are a fundamental concept in Java because they enable you to work with objects in a more abstract and flexible way. Instead of directly manipulating the object's memory, you can use references to access and modify the object's state.">reference</a> to the current object. Usually, the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code> is used when an instance <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variable</a> and a constructor or a method variable share the same name. This keyword helps to disambiguate these situations.</p>
<p>If you write something like <code class="language-java">name = name</code>, it means that you're assigning the <code class="language-java">name</code> variable to itself, which, of course, doesn't make any sense. Frankly speaking, you may distinguish two objects simply by assigning another name to the variable, like <code class="language-java">name = newName</code>. It is not prohibited, but it is considered bad practice since these variables point to the same thing. These are the reasons why the keyword <code class="language-java">this</code>is extremely useful with constructors, fields, and methods. The absence of extra variables makes the code look clearer and less overloaded.</p>
<h5 id="default-and-no-argument-constructor">Default and no-argument constructor</h5>
<p>The compiler automatically provides <strong>a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11354" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the default value for a variable is the default value of its type. | If you don't define a specific constructor, the default constructor will not be created.

If a specific constructor is defined, the default constructor will not be created. No-argument constructors are useful in cases when any default value is better than no value at all. They allow you to create an instance of the class using the no-argument default constructor, in which all fields will be filled with the default value of their type.">no-argument constructor</a></strong> for any class without constructors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {

    String name;
    int age;
    float height;
}</code></pre>
<p>We can create an instance of the class <code class="language-java">Patient</code> using the no-argument default constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();</code></pre>
<p>In this case, all fields will be filled with the default values of their types.</p>
<p>If you define a specific constructor, the default constructor will not be created.</p>
<p>We can also define a constructor without any arguments, but use it to set default values for fields of a class. For example, we can initialize <code class="language-java">name</code> with <code class="language-java">"Unknown"</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {

    String name;
    int age;
    float height;

    public Patient() {
        this.name = "Unknown";
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Such no-argument constructors are useful in cases when any default value is better than <code class="language-java">null</code>.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p><strong>Constructors </strong>are special methods used to initialize class objects when they are created using the <code class="language-java">new</code> keyword. They have the same name as the class they belong to and have no return type (not even void). Constructors are necessary for initializing class objects and can take parameters to initialize fields with specific values. The <code class="language-java">this</code> keyword is used in the constructor to reference the current object. If a class doesn't have explicit constructors, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor.<br/><br/>
