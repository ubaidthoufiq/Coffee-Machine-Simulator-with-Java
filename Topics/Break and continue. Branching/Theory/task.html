<h2>Break and continue. Branching</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In certain cases, you may want to alter the standard behavior of a loop. The Java programming language provides <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A branching statement in Java is a control flow mechanism that allows for a departure from the standard sequence of statement execution. | It enables the program to alter the flow of a loop or conditional statement based on a specific condition. The two main branching statements in Java are 'break' and 'continue'. The 'break' statement terminates the current loop or switch case, while the 'continue' statement skips the current iteration of a loop. Proper use of these statements is crucial for writing clear, organized, and efficient code.">branching statements</a></strong> for this purpose that can terminate a loop or skip some of its <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3574" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Iteration in Java refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a specific condition is met. | This is typically accomplished through loops, which are control structures that enable the program to cycle through a series of statements multiple times. Java offers various loop types, such as while, do-while, for, and for-each loops, each designed to cater to different use cases and scenarios.

It can be a valuable tool for controlling the flow of your program, especially when you need to exit loops prematurely. On the other hand, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one. It is useful for situations where you want to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions. However, it's essential to exercise caution when using these statements. Overuse of branching statements can lead to code that is challenging to read and maintain. Therefore, it's recommended to employ them sparingly, primarily when it enhances code clarity and conciseness.</p>
