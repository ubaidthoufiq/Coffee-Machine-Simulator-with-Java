<h2>Multiple conditions: switch</h2>

<p>You already know how to shape the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Control flow in Java refers to the order in which various parts of a program are executed. | It is often managed using control flow statements, which determine the flow of execution based on certain conditions. The program's control structure can be visualized as a tree, where each node represents a statement or a block of statements, and the edges represent the flow of control. The two most common control flow statements are the if-else statement and the while loop, which control the flow of execution based on a boolean condition.">control flow</a> of a program using if-else statements. Perhaps, you have faced situations in which you had to stack and nest multiple if-else statements to get the desired result. In this topic, you will learn an alternative way to deal with multiple choices: <strong>the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/16036" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, switch statement is a control flow statement that allows for the evaluation of an expression against multiple cases. | It provides an alternative to long chains of if-else statements, enhancing code readability. However, switch statements can be verbose and prone to errors due to strict requirements for placing statements. To address these issues, Java introduced switch expressions, which offer a more concise and less error-prone alternative. Switch expressions yield a value, assigned to a variable, and can use a new arrow syntax for brevity.">switch statement</a></strong>. It enhances code readability, efficiency, and organization compared to lengthy <code class="language-java">if-else</code> chains, making it valuable for handling multiple conditions.</p>
<h5 id="when-a-conditional-statement-is-not-so-good" style="text-align: center;">When a conditional statement is not so good</h5>
<p>Suppose you need to write a program that performs different actions depending on the value of a variable. For example, choosing an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/29027" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An action in Java is an interface that describes some behavior or functionality that a class or object can perform. | It is a way to define a set of methods that a class must implement, without providing the implementation details. This allows for greater flexibility and modularity in programming, as classes can be designed to work with any implementation of the action interface.">action</a> from the menu of a game. To do that you can use a conditional statement with multiple branches as shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int action = ...; // a certain value from 1 to 4
        
if (action == 1) {
    System.out.println("Starting a new game...");
} else if (action == 2) {
    System.out.println("Loading a saved game");
} else if (action == 3) {
    System.out.println("Displaying help...");
} else if (action == 4) {
    System.out.println("Exiting...");
} else {
    System.out.println("Unsuitable action, please, try again");
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this code handles the task. But if your conditional statement has a lot of branches, it can be hard to understand for people.</p>

<p>With the switch statement, the previous code will look like this:</p>

We have not explained the keywords <code class="language-java">switch</code>, <code class="language-java">case</code> and <code class="language-java">break</code> yet, but you can already guess what they mean.</p>
<h5 id="the-general-form-of-the-switch-statement" style="text-align: center;">The general form of the switch statement</h5>
<p>The most general form of the switch statement is the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // do something here
        break;
    case value2:
        // do something here
        break;
    
    //... other cases
    
    case valueN:
        // do something here
        break;
    default:
        // do something by default
        break; // it can be omitted
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-java">switch</code> and <code class="language-java">case</code> keywords are always required here. The keywords <code class="language-java">break</code> and <code class="language-java">default</code> are optional. The keyword <code class="language-java">break </code>stops the execution of the whole switch statement, not just one case.</p>
<p>If a <code class="language-java">case</code> does not have the <code class="language-java">break</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a keyword is a reserved word that has a special meaning in the programming language. | These words cannot be used as variable names in your own program. Keywords are part of the syntax, a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid.

However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a>, the following <code class="language-java">case</code> will be executed as well, including the <code class="language-java">default</code> case. The <code class="language-java">default</code> case is also executed if there's no other <code class="language-java">case</code> that matches the variable value. The <code class="language-java">break</code> keyword in the <code class="language-java">default</code> branch is optional and can be omitted.</p>
<p>A <code class="language-java">case</code> section may contain any block of code, even a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a nested class is a class that is declared inside another class. | The class that contains the nested class is often referred to as the outer class, and the nested class is referred to as a member of the outer class.

<p>Let's consider another example. The following code outputs the names of integer numbers or a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3535" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the default value for a variable is the default value of its type. | If you don't define a specific constructor, the default constructor will not be created. If a class has no explicit constructor, the Java compiler automatically provides a default no-argument constructor.">default</a> text. This switch statement has three base cases and a single default case.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int val = ...;
switch (val) {
     case 0:
         System.out.println("zero");
         break;
     case 1:
         System.out.println("one");
         break;
     case 2:
         System.out.println("two");
         break;
     default:
         System.out.println("The value is less than zero or greater than two");
} </code></pre>
<p>If <code class="language-java">val</code> is 0, the code prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">zero</code></pre>
<p>If <code class="language-java">val</code> is 1, the code <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console.

<p>if <code class="language-java">val</code> is 10, the code prints:</p>

<p>If you forget the keyword <code class="language-java">break</code> in a case, the compiler won't consider it an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3497" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an error is a type of exception that indicates a problem has occurred during the execution of a program. | It is a runtime exception, meaning it occurs while the program is running, and it interrupts the normal flow of the program.

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>When you have a limited number of cases to choose from, switch statements can help you avoid extensive if-else constructions. For that, you need the <code class="language-java">switch</code> keyword to introduce the value to evaluate, and <code class="language-java">case</code> for each of the possible values. Do not forget to also use the <code class="language-java">break</code> keyword to avoid executing extra cases and <code class="language-java">default</code> branch to indicate the default behavior.</p>
