<h2>While and do-while loops</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>There are a number of approaches to repeating a fragment of the code while a certain condition is <code class="language-java">true</code>. In this lesson, we will learn how to do it by using two kinds of loops. They differ in the order of the repeated fragment execution and condition evaluation.</p><h5 id="the-while-loop">The while loop</h5><p>The <strong>while</strong> loop consists of a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3533" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A block in Java is a group of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. | It is used to define a scope for variables and statements, and to group statements that should be executed together. Blocks can be used to define methods, constructors, initializer blocks, and control structures such as loops and if-else statements. The statements within a block are executed sequentially, and any variables declared within the block are only accessible within that block.">block</a> of code and a condition (a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3516" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, boolean is a data type that has only two possible values: true and false. | It is also known as the logical type and is commonly used to represent something that has only two opposite states, like on or off, yes or no. Variables of the boolean type are often used to build logical expressions using logical operators, such as not, and, or, and xor. These operators allow for straightforward comparison of numeric values and can be seamlessly integrated into mixed expressions with arithmetic operators.">Boolean</a> expression). If the condition is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the code within the block is executed. This code repeats until the condition becomes <code class="language-java">false</code>. Since this loop checks the condition before the block is executed, the control structure is also known as a <strong>pre-test loop</strong>. You can think of the <strong>while</strong> loop as a repetitive <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A conditional statement in Java is a programming construct that allows a program to make decisions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. | It enables the program to execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of the condition. The basic structure of a conditional statement in Java is an if keyword followed by a boolean expression in parentheses, and a body enclosed in curly braces. If the expression is true, the code inside the curly braces is executed, otherwise, it is skipped.">conditional statement</a>.</p><p>The basic syntax of the <strong>while</strong> loop is the following:</p><pre><code class="language-java">while (condition) {
    // body: do something repetitive
}</code></pre><p>A loop's body can contain any correct Java statements, including conditional statements and even other loops, the latter being called nested loops.</p><p>It is also possible to write an <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3505" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An infinite loop in Java is a loop that keeps executing indefinitely because the condition that controls the loop never becomes false. | This can occur due to a programming error, such as forgetting to update a variable that is used in the loop's condition, or intentionally, for example, when a program needs to continuously monitor for certain events. Infinite loops can cause a program to become unresponsive or consume excessive system resources, so they should be used with caution.">infinite loop</a></strong> if the condition is invariably <code class="language-java">true</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">while (true) {
    // body: do something indefinitely
}</code></pre><p>The application of infinite loops will be considered in the following topics.</p><p><strong>Example 1.</strong> The following loop <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console. Unlike 'println', 'print' does not add a newline character after the output, meaning that subsequent print statements will continue writing on the same line. It's a fundamental tool for providing feedback and displaying results in a Java program.">prints</a> integer numbers while a variable is less than 5.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int i = 0;
while (i &lt; 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
// next statement</code></pre><p>Let's explain how this loop works. First, the value 0 is assigned to the variable <code class="language-java">i</code>. Before the first execution of the loop's body, the program checks if the condition <code class="language-java">i &lt; 5</code> is true. In our case, <code class="language-java">i</code> is 0, so the condition is true and the body of the loop starts executing. The body has two statements: displaying the current value of <code class="language-java">i</code> and incrementing it by 1. After this is done, the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An expression in Java is a combination of variables, operators, and method invocations that yield a value when evaluated. | It can be a simple literal, variable, or operator, or a complex mix of these elements. Expressions are fundamental to programming as they allow you to perform calculations, manipulate data, and make decisions. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, or used in control flow structures like if-else statements and loops. Understanding expressions is crucial for writing effective Java code.">expression</a> <code class="language-java">i &lt; 5</code> is evaluated again. Now <code class="language-java">i</code> equals 1, so the condition is still <code class="language-java">true</code>, and the loop's body is repeated again. This is repeated until <code class="language-java">i</code> has taken the value 5, after which the expression <code class="language-java">i &lt; 5</code> ceases to be <code class="language-java">true</code>, and the execution of this loop terminates. The program proceeds to the next statement after the loop.</p><p><strong>The output:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-java">0

Because <strong>do-while</strong> loops check the condition after the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a <strong>post-test loop</strong>. In contrast to the <strong>while </strong>loop, which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed, the <strong>do-while</strong> loop is an exit-condition loop. So, the code within the block is always executed at least once.</p><p>This loop contains three parts: the <code class="language-java">do</code> keyword, a body, and <code class="language-java">while(condition)</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">do {

In this topic, we've discussed two alternative ways to use loops that are based on conditional statement evaluation. If you want to check the condition first and, based on the result, perform the operations or ignore them at all, the <strong>while </strong>loop is your choice. If you want to do one iteration of the loop in any case and then evaluate the condition for <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/14268" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Repetition in Java refers to the ability to execute a block of code multiple times. | This is often achieved using loops, which can iterate over a range of values or through an array. If the number of iterations or the range borders are known, it is recommended to use a for-loop. If they are unknown, a while-loop may be the preferable solution. The basic syntax of a for-loop includes the loop declaration (initialization, condition, and increment), the loop body, and the loop control variable.">repetition</a>, then choose <strong>do-while</strong>. Both types of loops can be used to read a sequence from the standard input: for <strong>do-while</strong>, you may use some stop value to terminate the loop, for <strong>while</strong>, use the <code class="language-java">hasNext()</code> method to check that the input is over.</p>
