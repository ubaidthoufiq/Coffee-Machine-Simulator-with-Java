<p>The <code class="language-java">char</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a 'type' refers to a classification of data that determines the values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | This can include primitive types (such as int, char, or boolean) and reference types (such as classes, interfaces, or arrays). Each type has a specific size and range of values it can represent, and the operations that can be performed on it are defined by the language. Understanding the different types in Java is essential for writing correct and efficient code, as well as for understanding the behavior of existing code.">type</a> is used to represent letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols. Each <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a character is a single symbol, denoted with a single quote, that can represent a letter, digit, whitespace, or other symbols. | It is actually an integer type that stores the Unicode integer value of each character, which is why character literals can be used as integers if needed. The numeric value of a character can be found in a special table online, and since Java 7, underscores can be used between digits to increase the readability of numeric literals.">character</a> is just a symbol enclosed in single quotes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char lowerCaseLetter = 'a';
char upperCaseLetter = 'Q';
char number = '1';

<p>This type can represent all characters in all languages as well as some special and computer symbols. It corresponds to the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3510" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, Unicode is a character encoding standard that assigns unique numerical values, called code points, to every character in various writing systems, making it a universal character encoding scheme. | Java uses Unicode as its native character encoding format, which means that every character in Java, whether it is a letter, digit, or symbol, is represented as a Unicode code point. Java's char data type is a 16-bit type that stores the Unicode value of a character, and it can represent all characters in all languages and some special and computer symbols.">Unicode</a></strong> (UTF-16) format. Unicode is a computer encoding methodology that assigns a unique number for every character. It doesn't matter what language, or computer platform it's on. This is important in a global, networked world, and for computer systems that must accommodate multiple languages and special characters. Unicode truly unifies all of these into a single standard.</p>
<h5 id="initializing-characters-with-codes">Initializing characters with codes</h5>
<p>A character can also be created using its hexadecimal code in <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Unicode table</a>. The code starts with <code class="language-java">\u</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char ch = '\u0040'; // it represents '@'
System.out.println(ch); // @</code></pre>
<p>Although we use a sequence of characters to represent such a code, the code represents exactly one character.</p>
<p>As an example, capital Latin letters have hexadecimal codes from <code class="language-java">'\u0041'</code> to <code class="language-java">'\u005A'</code>, and small Latin letters have codes from <code class="language-java">'\u0061'</code> to <code class="language-java">'\u007A'</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-java">char</code> type has a minimum value encoded as  <code class="language-java">'\u0000'</code> and the maximum value encoded as <code class="language-java">'\uffff'</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to initialize a char with a positive integer number.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char ch = 64;
System.out.println(ch); // @</code></pre>
<p>The number <code class="language-java">64</code> just corresponds to the Unicode hexadecimal code <code class="language-java">'\u0040'</code>.</p>
<p>Any <code class="language-java">char</code> variable may be considered as an unsigned integer value in the range from 0 to 65535.</p>
<h5 id="retrieving-subsequent-characters">Retrieving subsequent characters</h5>
<p>There are two operators for adding (<code class="language-java">+</code>) and subtracting (<code class="language-java">-</code>) integer numbers in order to get the next and previous character according to the Unicode order.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">char ch = 'b';
ch += 1; // 'c'
ch -= 2; // 'a'</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to add or subtract two characters.</p>

ch += 'a';

<p>There are some special characters starting with a backslash <code class="language-java">\</code> which are known as the escape or control sequences.

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">char</code>type can represent characters from all languages and special symbols, thanks to its <strong>Unicode </strong>support. Characters can be initialized using their hexadecimal Unicode codes, which are denoted by <code class="language-java">'\u'</code> followed by the code. The char type has a minimum value of <code class="language-java">'\u0000'</code> and a maximum value of <code class="language-java">'\uffff'</code>. Characters can be manipulated using arithmetic operations to retrieve subsequent or previous characters based on their <strong>Unicode </strong>order. Escape sequences, starting with a backslash <code class="language-java">'\'</code>, are used to represent special characters that don't have corresponding symbols on a keyboard. Understanding the <code class="language-java">char</code>type and its capabilities is essential for working with textual <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9723" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, data is separated into two main categories: primitive types and reference types. | Primitive types are built-in data types provided by the language, such as int for integers, and they are represented as lowercase keywords.
