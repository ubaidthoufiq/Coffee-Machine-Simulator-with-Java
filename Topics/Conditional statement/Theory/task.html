<h2>Conditional statement</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>The <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3506" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A conditional statement in Java is a programming construct that allows a program to make decisions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. | It enables the program to execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of the condition. The basic structure of a conditional statement in Java is an if keyword followed by a boolean expression in parentheses, and a body enclosed in curly braces. If the expression is true, the code inside the curly braces is executed, otherwise, it is skipped.">conditional statement</a></strong> is a construction that allows a program to perform different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10570" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Computation in Java refers to the process of performing operations on data within a program. | This can include arithmetic operations, logical comparisons, and manipulation of data structures. Java's strong typing system ensures type safety during computation, while its object-oriented nature allows for complex data types and methods to be used in computations. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) enables write once, run anywhere capability, allowing computations to be performed consistently across different platforms.">computations</a> depending on the value of a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3516" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, boolean is a data type that has only two possible values: true and false. | It is also known as the logical type and is commonly used to represent something that has only two opposite states, like on or off, yes or no. Variables of the boolean type are often used to build logical expressions using logical operators, such as not, and, or, and xor. These operators allow for straightforward comparison of numeric values and can be seamlessly integrated into mixed expressions with arithmetic operators.">Boolean</a> expression. If it is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the program performs one computation; otherwise, if it is <code class="language-java">false</code>, the program performs another computation. Here are some examples of Boolean expressions:  <code class="language-java">a &gt; b</code>, <code class="language-java">i - j == 1</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The conditional statement has different forms. We will use all of them.</p>
<h5 id="the-single-if-case">The single if-case</h5>
<p>The simplest form of the conditional statement consists of the keyword <code class="language-java">if</code>, a Boolean <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An expression in Java is a combination of variables, operators, and method invocations that yield a value when evaluated. | It can be a simple literal, variable, or operator, or a complex mix of these elements. Expressions are fundamental to programming as they allow you to perform calculations, manipulate data, and make decisions. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, or used in control flow structures like if-else statements and loops. Understanding expressions is crucial for writing effective Java code.">expression</a> enclosed in parentheses, and a body enclosed in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3687" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, curly braces are used to define the scope of a block of code. | They enclose the body of a class, method, or any other block of code. The opening curly brace is placed at the end of the line where the block begins, while the closing curly brace is placed at the beginning of the next line. This convention helps to improve the readability of the code.">curly braces</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression) {
    // body: do something
}</code></pre>
<p>If the expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the statements inside the code block are executed; otherwise, the program skips them.</p>
<p>See the following example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int age = ...; // it has a value
if (age &gt; 100) {
    System.out.println("Very experienced person");
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example, if the <code class="language-java">age</code> is greater than 100 the code prints <strong>"Very experienced person"</strong>, otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will see a situation where the expression in a condition is a single <code class="language-java">boolean</code> type variable. Instead of writing <code class="language-java">b == true</code> or <code class="language-java">b == false</code>, use this variable (or its negation with <code class="language-java">!</code>) as the Boolean expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">boolean b = ...; // it is true or false
if (b) { // or !b
    // do something
}</code></pre>
<p>A conditional statement can be used in any place in a program where the statement is expected. It can even be nested inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks.</p>
<h5 id="the-if-else-cases">The if-else-cases</h5>
<p>The if-case above can be extended with the keyword <code class="language-java">else</code> and another body to do alternative actions when the expression is <code class="language-java">false</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression) {    
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
} </code></pre>
<p>In this case, if the expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, then the first code block is executed; otherwise, the second code block is executed, but not both together.</p>
<p>In the example below,  the program outputs different text depending on the value of <code class="language-java">num</code> (even or odd).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Note: a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3494" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a number is a data type that represents a numeric value. | It can be an integer, which is a whole number, or a floating-point number, which is a number with a decimal point. Java provides several integer types, including `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`, with `int` being the most commonly used. For floating-point numbers, Java provides `float` and `double` types, with `double` being the most commonly used.">number</a> is even if it can be divided exactly by 2; otherwise it's odd.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">int num = ...; // the num is initialized by some value

if (num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("It's an even number");
} else {    
    System.out.println("It's an odd number");
}</code></pre>
<p>Since a number can only be even or odd, only one message will be displayed. If <code class="language-java">num</code> is 10, the program outputs <code class="language-java">"It's an even number"</code>. If the value is 11, it outputs <code class="language-java">"It's an odd number"</code>.</p>
<h5 id="the-if-else-if-cases">The if-else-if-cases</h5>
<p>The most general form of the conditional statement consists of several conditions and <code class="language-java">else-if</code>-branches.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (expression0) {
    // do something
} else if (expression1) {
    // do something else 1
// ...
} else if (expressionN) {
    // do something else N
}</code></pre>
<p>The following code outputs recommendations about what computer you need to buy depending on your budget.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">long dollars = ...; // your budget

if (dollars &lt; 1000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a laptop");
} else if (dollars &lt; 2000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a personal computer");
} else if (dollars &lt; 100_000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a server");
} else {
    System.out.println("Buy a data center or a quantum computer");
}</code></pre>
<p>This conditional statement has four branches: <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 1000</code>, <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 2000</code>, <code class="language-java">dollars &lt; 100_000</code> and <code class="language-java">dollars &gt;= 100_000</code>. For example, if the value of <code class="language-java">dollars</code> is <code class="language-java">10_000</code>, it <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console.

<p>A conditional statement with multiple branches creates a <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A decision tree in Java is a graphical representation of possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions. | It is a flowchart-like structure, where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a decision.
