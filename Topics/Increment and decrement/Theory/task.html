<h2>Increment and decrement</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In this topic, we will discuss one of the most famous <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3582" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operation in Java refers to a specific action performed on data, such as arithmetic, logical, or relational operations. | Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, while logical operations involve Boolean values using AND, OR, and NOT. Relational operations compare values and return a Boolean result, such as equal to, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to. These operations are fundamental to programming and are used to manipulate and evaluate data within a Java program.">operations</a> in programming: <strong>increment</strong>.

Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variable</a> by one. Fun fact: the name of the C++ programming language is a reference to this operation, signifying the evolutionary nature of the changes from C.</p><h5 id="using-and-in-java">Using ++ and -- in Java</h5><p>Java has two opposite operations called <strong>increment</strong> (<code class="language-java">++</code>) and <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3550" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, decrement is a fundamental operation used to decrease the value of a variable by one. | It is the opposite of the increment operation. The decrement operator has two forms: prefix (--n) and postfix (n--). In prefix form, the value is decremented before it is used in a statement, while in postfix form, the value is decremented after it is used. Understanding these operations is crucial due to their widespread use in various aspects of programming.">decrement</a></strong> (<code class="language-java">--</code>), which increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.</p><pre><code class="language-java">int n = 10;

n += 1; // 11
n -= 1; // 10</code></pre><h5 id="prefix-and-postfix-forms">Prefix and postfix forms</h5><p>Both increment and decrement operators have two forms, which are very important when using the result in the current statement:</p><ul><li><p>the <strong>prefix</strong> form (<code class="language-java">++n</code> or <code class="language-java">--n</code>) increases or decreases the value of a variable before it is used;</p></li><li><p>the <strong>postfix </strong>form (<code class="language-java">n++</code> or <code class="language-java">n--</code>) increases or decreases the value of a variable after it is used.</p></li></ul><p>The following examples demonstrate both forms of increment.</p><p><strong>Prefix increment:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-java">int a = 4;
int b = ++a;

System.out.println(a); // 5
System.out.println(b); // 5</code></pre><p>In this case, the value of <code class="language-java">a</code> has been incremented and then assigned to <code class="language-java">b</code>.

System.out.println(b); // 4

Java follows a specific set of rules for operator precedence, with some operators having higher precedence than others. For example, arithmetic operators like multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. This means that if an expression contains both types of operators, the multiplication and division operations will be performed first before the addition and subtraction operations.">precedence</a> than the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, assignment operator is denoted by '=' and is used to assign a single value or a result of an expression to a variable. | The initialization is the value or result of an expression that is assigned to the variable. The assignment operator can also be combined with an operation to avoid repeating the variable, such as +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=. These forms are more concise and preferred in certain situations.">assignment operator</a>. However, it returns the original value of <code class="language-java">a</code>, not the incremented one. That's why when we assign <code class="language-java">a++</code>  to <code class="language-java">b</code>,  we actually assign 4,  and then variable <code class="language-java">a</code> is incremented. So, <code class="language-java">b</code> is 4 and <code class="language-java">a</code> is 5.</p><p>If that's still not clear enough for you, take a look at the code:</p><pre><code class="language-java">int a = 4;

These operations can be used in two forms: prefix (++n or --n), which modifies the value before its use in a statement, and postfix (n++ or n--), which modifies it after. Grasping these operations is vital due to their widespread use in many aspects of programming.</p>
