<h2>Integer types and operations</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Java provides several types which represent <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3532" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an integer number is a type of primitive data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, as well as zero. | The most commonly used integer types are byte, short, int, and long, with int being the default type. These types can store numbers within specific ranges, with int being able to store numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.">integer numbers</a> including positive, negative, and zero. In practice, the most used types are <code class="language-java">int</code> and <code class="language-java">long</code>. The first type can store numbers from a smaller range than the second one, but it is often enough (especially, in this topic). You can perform all <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3519" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An arithmetic operation in Java refers to mathematical calculations performed on numerical values using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). The modulus operator calculates the remainder of a division operation. Java supports various integer types, such as int and long, which can be used to perform these arithmetic operations. Arithmetic operations can also be compared using relational operators, such as greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), and equal to (==).">arithmetic operations</a> (<code class="language-java">+</code>, <code class="language-java">-</code>, <code class="language-java">*</code>, <code class="language-java">/</code>, <code class="language-java">%</code>) with variables of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3532" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the integer type is a primitive data type that represents whole numbers, including positive, negative, and zero. | The most commonly used integer types are `int` and `long`.
